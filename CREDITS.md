## Authors

**[Joey (NV0N)](https://github.com/rinchen)** created the original [Meshtastic Mac Client](https://github.com/Denver-Mesh/meshtastic_mac_client) — a Python/PyQt6 desktop app for macOS. Joey built it out of frustration with the lack of native BLE-capable Meshtastic clients for Mac and shared it with the Denver Meshtastic community.

**[dude.eth](https://github.com/defidude)** ported the concept to Electron, enabling cross-platform support across Mac, Linux, and Windows. Both Joey and dude.eth are now actively co-developing this Electron version together.
